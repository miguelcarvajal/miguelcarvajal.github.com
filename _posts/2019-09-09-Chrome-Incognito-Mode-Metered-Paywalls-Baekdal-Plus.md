> So the metered paywall is not really a special form of monetization, it's just one of the many variations of models that compares the value you get when you subscribe, and the level of annoyance or limitations you put up for those who don't.

> The key element, though, is the value part. It's how strong that value is, and also how frequently you use it, that defines what specific model you can use. And there is a general rule of thumb that the higher and the more specific the value you provide, the stronger the paywall you can create.
